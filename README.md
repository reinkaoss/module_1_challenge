# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The primary objective of this project was to enhance the landing page's accessibility features; nevertheless, other elements of the general code were updated in order to provide a more organised and coherent project.
This project was created as a learning exercise to become more familiar with HTML tags and semantics as well as to better comprehend the best practises that contribute to a team workflow.

The two most significant changes were:
This project develops accessibility solutions to help people who might need to use screen readers, such as alt tags for images and icons;

When possible, "Divs" were used less and styling elements were grouped for a cleaner, more organised code. Some components were altered to conform to the standard HTML structure.
during the process I've learned the value of HTML Semantic Elements and how it affects a webpage's overall functionality depending on how the SEO algorithms interpret the elements on my website.
I've also discovered that having cleaner and more organised code can benefit not only my own workflow but also that of any coworkers who may be working on the same repository.

To make the code clear and succinct, comments were put between the segments. Excessive div components were also replaced with the appropriate HTML tags, such as "main," "section," "aside," etc.
